Binbo is a full-featured Chess representation written in pure Erlang using https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards[Bitboards]. It is basically aimed to be used on game servers where people play chess online.

It's called `Binbo` because its ground is a **bin**ary **bo**ard containing only _zeros_ and _ones_ (`0` and `1`) since this is the main meaning of Bitboards as an internal chessboard representation.

Binbo also uses the https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards[Magic Bitboards] approach for a **blazing fast** move generation of sliding pieces (rook, bishop, and queen).

**Note:** it's not a chess engine but it could be a good starting point for it. It can play the role of a core (regarding move generation and validation) for multiple chess engines running on distributed Erlang nodes, since Binbo is an OTP application itself.

In addition, the application is able to communicate with https://www.chessprogramming.org/Category:UCI[chess engines that support UCI protocol] (https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI[Universal Chess Interface]) such as _Stockfish_, _Shredder_, _Houdini_, etc. You can therefore write your own client-side or server-side **chess bot** application on top of Binbo, or just play with engine right in Erlang shell.

Binbo is part of the https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir[Awesome Elixir] list.

== Requirements

** https://www.erlang.org/[Erlang/OTP] 20.0 or higher.
** https://www.rebar3.org/[rebar3]

== Quick start

Clone repository, change directory to `binbo` and run `rebar3 shell` (or `make shell`):

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/DOBRO/binbo.git
$ cd binbo
$ rebar3 shell
----

=== Common example

.In the Erlang shell:
[source,erlang]
----
%% Start Binbo application first:
binbo:start().

%% Start new process for the game:
{ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().

%% Start new game in the process:
binbo:new_game(Pid).

%% Or start new game with a given FEN:
binbo:new_game(Pid, <<"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1">>).

%% Look at the board with ascii or unicode pieces:
binbo:print_board(Pid).
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode]).

%% Make move for White and Black:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e2e4">>).
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e7e5">>).

%% Have a look at the board again:
binbo:print_board(Pid).
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode]).
----

[[quickstart-play-with-engine]]
=== Play with engine

.In the Erlang shell:
[source,erlang]
----
%% Start Binbo application first:
> binbo:start().
{ok,[compiler,syntax_tools,uef,binbo]}

%% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.157.0>}

%% Set full path to the engine's executable file:
> EnginePath = "/usr/local/bin/stockfish".
"/usr/local/bin/stockfish"

%% Start new game in the process:
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => EnginePath}).
{ok,continue}

%% Which side is to move?
> binbo:side_to_move(Pid).
{ok,white}

%% Say, you want to play Black. Tell the engine to make move for White.
> binbo:uci_play(Pid, #{}).
{ok,continue,<<"e2e4">>}

%% Make your move for Black and get the engine's move immediately:
> binbo:uci_play(Pid, #{}, <<"e7e5">>).
{ok,continue,<<"g1f3">>}   % the engine's move was "g1f3"

%% Make your next move for Black and, again, get the engine's move at once:
> binbo:uci_play(Pid, #{}, <<"b8c6">>).
{ok,continue,<<"b1c3">>}   % the engine's move was "b1c3"

%% Look at the board with ascii or unicode pieces.
%% Flip the board to see Black on downside:
binbo:print_board(Pid, [flip]).
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode, flip]).

%% It's your turn now. Let the engine search for the best move for you with default options.
%% No move actually done, just hint:
> binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid, #{}).
{ok,<<"g8f6">>}

%% Tell the engine to search for the best move at depth 20:
> binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid, #{depth => 20}).
{ok,<<"g8f6">>}

%% To make the gameplay more convenient, introduce new function:
> Play = fun(Move) -> Result = binbo:uci_play(Pid, #{}, Move), binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode, flip]), Result end.

%% Now, with this function, go through three steps at once:
%%   - make move "g8f6",
%%   - get the engine's move,
%%   - see how the position was changed.
> Play("g8f6").

== Interface

There are three steps to be done before making game moves:

. Start Binbo application.
. Create process for the game.
. Initialize game state in the process.

**Note:** process creation and game initialization are separated for the following reason: since Binbo is aimed to handle a number of concurrent games, the game process should be started as quick as possible leaving the http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html[supervisor] doing the same job for another game. It's important for high-load systems where game creation is a very frequent event.

=== Starting application

To start Binbo, call:

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:start().
----

=== Creating game process

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:new_server() -> {ok, Pid} | {error, Reason}.
binbo:new_server(Options) -> {ok, Pid} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` - pid of the created process;
* `Options` - options for the game process (see link:#server-options[bellow]).

.So, to start one or more game processes:
[source,erlang]
----
{ok, Pid1} = binbo:new_server(),
{ok, Pid2} = binbo:new_server(),
{ok, Pid3} = binbo:new_server().
----

[[server-options]]
==== Options for the game process
[source,erlang]
----
binbo:set_server_options(Pid, Options) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
----

`Pid` is the `pid` of the game process.

.`Options`:
[source,erlang]
----
#{
  idle_timeout => timeout(),
  onterminate  => {fun my_callback/4, Arg}
}
----

.where:
* `idle_timeout` - time in milliseconds with no messages received before the game process exits. Defaults to `infinity`.
* `onterminate` - tuple where the first element is a callback function that performs when process exits. This function must be of *arity 4* with argumnents `Pid`, `Reason`, `GameState`, and `Arg` where:
** `Pid` - pid of the game process;
** `Reason` - the reason why the game process exited;
** `GameState` - the whole link:#game-state[game state];
** `Arg` - the argument you want to pass to the callback function.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
-module(on_terminate).

-export([run/0]).

run() ->
    binbo:start(),
    {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server(),
    binbo:new_game(Pid),
    binbo:set_server_options(Pid, #{
        idle_timeout => 1000,
        onterminate => {fun onterminate_callback/4, "my argument"}
    }),
    % 'onterminate_callback/4' will be called after 1000 ms
    ok.

onterminate_callback(GamePid, Reason, Game, Arg) ->
    io:format("GamePid: ~p~n", [GamePid]),
    io:format("Reason: ~p~n", [Reason]),
    io:format("Game: ~p~n", [Game]),
    io:format("Arg: ~p~n", [Arg]),
    ok.
----

.To reset options, call:
[source,erlang]
----
binbo:set_server_options(Pid, #{
    idle_timeout => infinity,
    onterminate => undefined
})
----


[[initializing-new-game]]
=== Initializing new game

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:new_game(Pid) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:new_game(Pid, Fen) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the `pid` of the process where the game is to be initialized;
* `Fen` (`string()` or `binary()`) is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation[Forsyth–Edwards Notation] (FEN);
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].

It is possible to reinitialize game in the same process. For example:

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:new_game(Pid),
binbo:new_game(Pid, Fen2),
binbo:new_game(Pid, Fen3).
----


.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.185.0>}

% New game from the starting position:
> binbo:new_game(Pid).
{ok,continue}

% New game with the given FEN:
> binbo:new_game(Pid, <<"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1">>).
{ok,continue}
----

=== Making moves

==== API

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:move(Pid, Move) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:san_move(Pid, Move) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:index_move(Pid, FromIndex, ToIndex) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:index_move(Pid, FromIndex, ToIndex, PromotionType) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

where:

* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `Move` is of `binary()` or `string()` type;
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].
* `FromIndex` - index of square a piece moves from.
* `ToIndex` - index of square a piece moves to.
* `PromotionType` - piece that a pawn should be promoted to, one of the atoms: `q`, `r`, `b`, `n` (_queen_, _rook_, _bishop_, _knight_). Defaults to `q` (_queen_).

Function `binbo:move/2` supports only _strict square notation_ with respect to argument `Move`, for example: `<<"e2e4">>`, `<<"e7e5">>`, etc.

Function `binbo:san_move/2` is intended to handle various formats of argument `Move` including https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)[_standard algebraic notation_] (*SAN*), for example: `<<"e4">>`, `<<"Nf3">>`, `<<"Qxd5">>`, `<<"a8=Q">>`, `<<"Rdf8">>`, `<<"R1a3">>`, `<<"O-O">>`, `<<"O-O-O">>`, `<<"e1e8">>`, etc.

Function `binbo:index_move/3,4` takes only square indices for the second and third parameter. For example, `binbo:index_move(Pid, 12, 28)` is the same as `binbo:move(Pid, <<"e2e4">>)`.

.Examples for `binbo:move/2`:

----

==== Castling

Binbo recognizes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling[castling] when:

* White king moves from `E1` to `G1` (`O-O`);
* White king moves from `E1` to `C1` (`O-O-O`);
* Black king moves from `E8` to `G8` (`O-O`);
* Black king moves from `E8` to `C8` (`O-O-O`).

Binbo also checks whether castling allowed or not acording to the chess rules.

.Castling examples:
[source,erlang]
----
% White castling kingside
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e1g1">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"O-O">>).

% White castling queenside
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e1c1">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"O-O-O">>).

% Black castling kingside
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e8g8">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"O-O">>).

% Black castling queenside
binbo:move(Pid, <<"e8c8">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"O-O-O">>).
----

==== Promotion

Binbo recognizes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)[promotion] when:

* White pawn moves from square of `rank 7` to square of `rank 8`;
* Black pawn moves from square of `rank 2` to square of `rank 1`.

.Promotion examples:
[source,erlang]
----
% White pawn promoted to Queen:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a7a8q">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a8=Q">>).
% or just:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a7a8">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a8">>).

% White pawn promoted to Knight:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a7a8n">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a8=N">>).

% Black pawn promoted to Queen:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a2a1q">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a1=Q">>).
% or just:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a2a1">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a1">>).

% Black pawn promoted to Knight:
binbo:move(Pid, <<"a2a1n">>).
binbo:san_move(Pid, <<"a1=N">>).
----

==== En passant

Binbo also recognizes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant[en passant capture] in strict accordance with the chess rules.

=== Getting FEN

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:get_fen(Pid) -> {ok, Fen}.
----

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
> binbo:get_fen(Pid).
{ok, <<"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1">>}.
----

=== PGN loading

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:load_pgn(Pid, PGN) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:load_pgn_file(Pid, Filename) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `PGN` is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation[Portable Game Notation], its type is `binary()`;
* `Filename` is a path to the file from which PGN is to be loaded. Its type is `binary()` or `string()`.
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].

Function `binbo:load_pgn/2` loads PGN itself.

If `PGN` is pretty large and you are able to load it from *local* file, to avoid sending large data between processes, use `binbo:load_pgn_file/2` since it's highly optimized for reading local files.

To extract move list, Binbo takes into account various cases specific to PGN such as _comments in braces_,
https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/18214/valid-pgn-variations[_recursive annotation variations_] (RAVs) and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_Annotation_Glyphs[_numeric annotation glyphs_] (NAGs).

.Examples:
[source,erlang]
----
%% Binary PGN:
load_pgn() ->
  PGN = <<"1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6">>,
  {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server(),
  binbo:load_pgn(Pid, PGN).

%% From file:
load_pgn_from_file() ->
  Filename = "/path/to/game.pgn",
  {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server(),
  binbo:load_pgn_file(Pid, Filename).
----

=== Board visualization

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:print_board(Pid) -> ok.
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode|ascii|flip]) -> ok.
----

You may want to see the current position right in Elang shell. To do it, call:
[source,erlang]
----
% With ascii pieces:
binbo:print_board(Pid).

% With unicode pieces:
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode]).

% Flipped board:
binbo:print_board(Pid, [flip]).
binbo:print_board(Pid, [unicode, flip]).
----

[[game-status]]
=== Game status

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:game_status(Pid) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the the pid of the game process;
* `GameStatus` is the game status itself;
* `Reason` is the reason why the game status cannot be obtained (usually due to the fact that the game is not initialized via link:#initializing-new-game[binbo:new_game/1,2]).

.The value of `GameStatus`:
* `continue` - game in progress;
* `checkmate` - one of the sides (White or Black) checkmated;
* `{draw, stalemate}` - draw because of stalemate;
* `{draw, rule50}` - draw according to the fifty-move rule;
* `{draw, insufficient_material}` - draw because of insufficient material;
* `{draw, threefold_repetition}` - draw according to the threefold repetition rule;
* `{draw, {manual, WhyDraw}}` - draw was set link:#setting-a-draw[manually] for the reason of `WhyDraw`.
* `{winner, Winner, {manual, WinnerReason}}` - winner `Winner` was set link:#setting-game-winner[manually] for the reason of `WinnerReason`.


=== List of legal moves

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:all_legal_moves(Pid) -> {ok, Movelist} | {error, Reason}.

binbo:all_legal_moves(Pid, Movetype) -> {ok, Movelist} | {ok, Number} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `Movelist` is a list of all legal moves for the current position. Each element of `Movelist` is a tuple `{From, To}` or `{From, To, Promo}`, where:
** `From` and `To` are starting and target square respectively.
** `Promo` is one of the _atoms_: `q`, `r`, `b`, `n` (i.e. _queen_, _rook_, _bishop_, and _knight_ respectively). Three-element tuple `{From, To, Promo}` occurs in case of *pawn promotion*.
* `Movetype` can take on of the values: `int`, `bin`, `str`, or `count`.

The call `binbo:all_legal_moves(Pid)` is the same as `binbo:all_legal_moves(Pid, int)`.

If `Movetype` is `count`, the function returns tuple `{ok, Number}` where `Number` is the number of legal moves.

The values of `From` and `To` depend on `Movetype` as follows:

* `int`: the values of `From` and `To` are _integers_ in range `0..63`, namely, square indices. For example, the move from `A1` to `H8` corresponds to `{0, 63}`. Use `int` to get the *fastest* reply from the game process.
* `bin`: the values of `From` and `To` are _binaries_. For example: `{<<"e2">>, <<"e4">>}`.
* `str`: the values of `From` and `To` are _strings_. For example: `{"e2", "e4"}`.

=== Side to move

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:side_to_move(Pid) -> {ok, white | black} | {error, Reason}.
----

If White is to move, it returns `{ok, white}`. If Black is to move, it returns `{ok, black}`.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.232.0>}

> binbo:new_game(Pid).
{ok,continue}

> binbo:side_to_move(Pid). % White is to move
{ok,white}

> binbo:move(Pid, <<"e2e4">>).
{ok,continue}

> binbo:side_to_move(Pid). % Black is to move now
{ok,black}
----

[[game-state]]
=== Game state

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:game_state(Pid) -> GameState.
binbo:set_game_state(Pid, GameState) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `GameState` is the whole game state.
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].

`binbo:game_state/1` returns a *raw* game state, it may be useful when you want to save it somehow (e.g. into a database) and then restore it in the future with `binbo:set_game_state(Pid, GameState)`. It's much faster than restoring game move by move incrementally.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.194.0>}

> binbo:new_game(Pid).
{ok,continue}

> GameState = binbo:game_state(Pid).

[[setting-a-draw]]
=== Setting a draw

It is possible to set a draw via API:

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:game_draw(Pid) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
binbo:game_draw(Pid, WhyDraw) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `WhyDraw` is the reason why a draw is to be set.

Calling `binbo:game_draw(Pid)` is the same as: `binbo:game_draw(Pid, undefined)`.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
% Players agreed to a draw:
> binbo:game_draw(Pid, by_agreement).
ok

% Trying to set a draw for the other reason:
> binbo:game_draw(Pid, other_reason).
{error,{already_has_status,{draw,{manual,by_agreement}}}}
----


[[setting-game-winner]]
=== Setting game winner

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, Winner) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, Winner, WinnerReason) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` is the pid of the game process;
* `Winner` is the winner, it can be any Erlang term (`white`, `black`, `'Bobby Fischer'`, etc.);
* `WinnerReason` is the reason why winner is to be set.

Calling `binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, Winner)` is the same as: `binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, Winner, undefined)`.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
% Black resigned
> binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, white, black_resigned).
ok

% Now the status of the game is: {winner,white,{manual,black_resigned}}
> binbo:game_status(Pid).
{ok,{winner,white,{manual,black_resigned}}}

% Trying to set the winner right after that (impossible):
> binbo:set_game_winner(Pid, white, black_lost_on_time).
{error,{already_has_status,{winner,white,
                                   {manual,black_resigned}}}}
----


=== Stopping game process

If, for some reason, you want to stop the game process and free resources, use:

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:stop_server(Pid) -> ok | {error, {not_pid, Pid}}.
----

Function terminates the game process with pid `Pid`.

=== Stopping application

To stop Binbo, call:

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:stop().
----

=== Using chess engines

You can write a chess bot application or play with engine using functions described in this section.

.Please note:
* Chess engine must support UCI protocol;
* Chess engine must be installed on the same machine where Binbo runs on.

Read the https://gist.github.com/DOBRO/2592c6dad754ba67e6dcaec8c90165bf[description of the Universal Chess Interface (UCI)] with examples for details.

* `Pid` is the `pid` of the process where the game is to be initialized;
* `EnginePath` is the full path to the engine's executable file (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/stockfish`);
* `Fen` is the Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN), defaults to initial if omitted;
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].


.Example:

  nodes  => pos_integer(),     % nodes <x> (search x nodes only)
  movetime => pos_integer()    % movetime <x> (search exactly x mseconds)
}.
----

`binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid)` is the same as `binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid, #{movetime => 1000})`, it sends command `go` to the engine.
`binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid, BestMoveOptions)` sends command `go ...` to the engine adding values associated with the keys of `BestMoveOptions`.

For example, calling `binbo:uci_bestmove(Pid, #{movetime =&gt; 2000, depth =&gt; 10})` means sending command `go movetime 2000 depth 10` to the engine.

**Note:** the very important option is `movetime`, it tells the engine how long (in milliseconds) to search for the best move. Defaults to **1000 milliseconds**.

Functions `binbo:uci_bestmove/2,3` do NOT change the position on the board, they return the bestmove as a hint. To make moves and play with engine, use functions link:#binbo-uci-play-docs[binbo:uci_play/2,3].

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().

binbo:uci_play(Pid, BestMoveOptions) -> {ok, GameStatus, EngineMove} | {error, Reason}.
binbo:uci_play(Pid, BestMoveOptions, YourMove) -> {ok, GameStatus, EngineMove} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` - `pid` of the game process;
* `BestMoveOptions` - options for the best move the engine should search for, same as options for link:#search-for-the-best-move[binbo:uci_bestmove/2];
* `EngineMove` - move that was done by the engine;
* `YourMove` - your move to send to the engine before it makes its move, e.g. `&lt;&lt;"e2e4"&gt;&gt;`, `&lt;&lt;"a7a8q"&gt;&gt;`, &#8230;
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].

Function `binbo:uci_play(Pid, BestMoveOptions)` goes through the following steps:

* the engine searches for the bestmove (`EngineMove`) from the current position;
* the engine makes this move and changes its internal position;
* tuple `{ok, GameStatus, EngineMove}` is returned.

The behaviour of function `binbo:uci_play(Pid, BestMoveOptions, YourMove)` is slightly different. Here are the steps it goes through:

* your move `YourMove` is sent to the engine;
* the engine receives `YourMove` and changes its internal position;
* the engine searches for the bestmove (`EngineMove`) from the changed position;
* the engine makes this move and changes its internal position;
* tuple `{ok, GameStatus, EngineMove}` is returned.

See how to play with engine in the link:#quickstart-play-with-engine[example] from _&quot;Quick start&quot;_ section.

==== Сhange position after the game is created

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:uci_set_position(Pid, Fen) -> {ok, GameStatus} | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` - `pid` of the game process;
* `Fen` is the Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN);
* `GameStatus` is the link:#game-status[game status].

Using this function you can change the position at any time. The game MUST be link:#start-new-game-with-engine[created] before.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.185.0>}

% Start new game from the initial position:
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => "/usr/local/bin/stockfish"}).

% Set up new position with the given FEN:
> binbo:uci_set_position(Pid, <<"r1bqk1nr/ppppppb1/2n3p1/7p/2PP4/5NPP/PP2PP2/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5">>).
{ok,continue}
----

==== Synchronize positions

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:uci_sync_position(Pid) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
----

.where:
* `Pid` - `pid` of the game process.

It can be useful to call this function when the position of the game process was changed somehow and the engine wasn't notified about that.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.185.0>}

% Start new game from the initial position:
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => "/usr/local/bin/stockfish"}).

% Make move (the engine knows nothing about it):
> binbo:move(Pid, "e2e4").
{ok,continue}

% Now synchronize the engine's position with the position of the game process:
> binbo:uci_sync_position(Pid).
ok
----

==== Send any command to engine

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:uci_command_call(Pid, Command) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
binbo:uci_command_cast(Pid, Command) -> ok.
----

.where:
* `Pid` - `pid` of the game process;
* `Command` - UCI command to send to the engine.

You can send any command to the engine with functions `binbo:uci_command_call/2` and `binbo:uci_command_cast/2`.

`binbo:uci_command_call/2` is a synchronous function, it calls https://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html#call-2[gen_server:call/2] inside. Returns `ok` if `Command` is sent, or tuple `{error, uci_port_not_open}` if the engine's process is not connected to the game process.

`binbo:uci_command_cast/2` is an asynchronous function, it calls https://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html#cast-2[gen_server:cast/2] inside. Returns `ok`. It also checks if the engine's process is connected to the game process before sending message and, if not connected, returns `ok` anyway.

.Example:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.185.0>}

% Start new game:
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => "/usr/local/bin/stockfish"}).
{ok,continue}

% Set hash to 32 MB (synchronous):
> binbo:uci_command_call(Pid, "setoption name Hash value 32").
ok

% Set hash to 32 MB (asynchronous):
> binbo:uci_command_cast(Pid, "setoption name Hash value 32").
ok
----

==== Handling messages from engine

[source,erlang]
----
binbo:set_uci_handler(Pid, Handler) -> ok.
----

.Types:
[source,erlang]
----
Pid :: pid().
Handler :: undefined | default | fun().
----

.where:
* `Pid` - `pid` of the game process;
* `Handler` - what to do with the message received from the engine.

If `Handler` is `undefined`, no operations are performed (the initial behaviour).

If `Handler` is set to `default`, function `binbo_uci:default_handler/1` from module link:src/binbo_uci.erl[binbo_uci] is performed. It just prints the message to the Erlang shell.

If `Handler` is a **function of arity 1**, this function is performed. The only argument the function takes is the message received from the engine.

`binbo:set_uci_handler/1` is an asynchronous function. You are able to call it any time you want.

**Note**: all the messages received from the engine are of `binary()` type.

.Example with default handler:
[source,erlang]
----
%% In the Erlang shell.

% Start new process for the game:
> {ok, Pid} = binbo:new_server().
{ok,<0.185.0>}

% Start new game (no message handler):
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => "/usr/local/bin/stockfish"}).
{ok,continue}

% Set default message handler:
> binbo:set_uci_handler(Pid, default).
ok

% Now start new game (with default message handler):
> binbo:new_uci_game(Pid, #{engine_path => "/usr/local/bin/stockfish"}).
{ok,continue}
----

== Binbo and Magic Bitboards

As mentioned above, Binbo uses https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards[Magic Bitboards], the fastest solution for move generation of sliding pieces
(rook, bishop, and queen). Good explanations of this approach can also be found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16925204/sliding-move-generation-using-magic-bitboard/30862064#30862064[here]
and http://vicki-chess.blogspot.com/2013/04/magics.html[here].

The main problem is to find the _index_ which is then used to lookup legal moves
of sliding pieces in a preinitialized move database.
The formula for the _index_ is:

._in C/C++:_
[source,c]
----
magic_index = ((occupied & mask) * magic_number) >> shift;
----

._in Erlang:_
[source,erlang]
----
MagicIndex = (((Occupied band Mask) * MagicNumber) bsr Shift).
----

._where:_
* `Occupied` is the bitboard of all pieces.
* `Mask` is the attack mask of a piece for a given square.
* `MagicNumber` is the magic number, see &quot;https://www.chessprogramming.org/Looking_for_Magics[Looking for Magics]&quot;.
* `Shift = (64 - Bits)`, where `Bits` is the number of bits corresponding to attack mask of a given square.

All values for _magic numbers_ and _shifts_ are precalculated before and stored in `binbo_magic.hrl`.

To be accurate, Binbo uses https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards#Fancy[Fancy Magic Bitboards].
It means that all moves are stored in a table of its own (individual) size for each square.
In _C/C++_ such tables are actually two-dimensional arrays and any move can be accessed by
a simple lookup:

[source,c]
----
move = global_move_table[square][magic_index]
----

._If detailed:_
[source,c]
----
moves_from = global_move_table[square];
move = moves_from[magic_index];
----

The size of `moves_from` table depends on piece and square where it is placed on. For example:

* for rook on `A1` the size of `moves_from` is `4096` (2^12 = 4096, 12 bits required for the attack mask);
* for bishop on `A1` it is `64` (2^6 = 64, 6 bits required for the attack mask).

There are no two-dimensional arrays in Erlang, and no global variables which could help us
to get the fast access to the move tables **from everywhere**.

So, how does Binbo beat this? Well, it's simple :&#41;.

Erlang gives us the power of _tuples_ and _maps_ with their blazing fast lookup of _elements/values_ by their _index/key_.

Since the number of squares on the chessboard is the constant value (it's always **64**, right?),
our `global_move_table` can be constructed as a _tuple_ of 64 elements, and each element of this _tuple_
is a _map_ containing the _key-value_ association as `MagicIndex =&gt; Moves`.

._If detailed, for moves:_
[source,erlang]
----
GlobalMovesTable = { MoveMap1, ..., MoveMap64 }
----

._where:_
[source,erlang]
----
MoveMap1  = #{
  MagicIndex_1_1 => Moves_1_1,
  ...
  MagicIndex_1_K => Moves_1_K
},
MoveMap64 = #{
  MagicIndex_64_1 => Moves_64_1, ...
  ...
  MagicIndex_64_N => Moves_64_N
},
----

and then we lookup legal moves from a square, say, `E4` (29th element of the _tuple_):

[source,erlang]
----
E4 = 29,
MoveMapE4   = erlang:element(E4, GlobalMovesTable),
MovesFromE4 = maps:get(MagicIndex, MovesMapE4).
----

To calculate _magic index_ we also need the _attack mask_ for a given square.
Every _attack mask_ generated is stored in a _tuple_ of 64 elements:

[source,erlang]
----
GlobalMaskTable = {Mask1, Mask2, ..., Mask64}
----

where `Mask1`, `Mask2`, ..., `Mask64` are _bitboards_ (integers).

Finally, if we need to get all moves from `E4`:

[source,erlang]
----
E4 = 29,
Mask = erlang:element(E4, GlobalMaskTable),
MagicIndex = ((Occupied band Mask) * MagicNumber) bsr Shift,
MoveMapE4   = erlang:element(E4, GlobalMovesTable),
MovesFromE4 = maps:get(MagicIndex, MovesMapE4).
----

Next, no global variables? We make them global!

How do we get the fastest access to the _move tables_ and to the _attack masks_ **from everywhere**?

http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html[ETS]? No! Using ETS as a storage for _static terms_ we get the overhead due to extra data copying during lookup.

And now we are coming to the fastest solution.

When Binbo starts up, all _move tables_ are initialized.
Once these tables (_tuples_, actually) initialized, they are "injected" into **dynamically generated
modules compiled at Binbo start**. Then, to get the values, we just call a _getter function_
(`binbo_global:get/1`) with the argument as the name of the corresponding dynamic module.

This awesome trick is used in MochiWeb library, see module https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/master/src/mochiglobal.erl[mochiglobal].

Using http://erlang.org/doc/man/persistent_term.html[persistent_term] (since OTP 21.2) for storing static data is also a good idea.
But it doesn't seem to be a better way for the following reason with respect to dynamic modules.
When Binbo stops, it gets them **unloaded** as they are not necessary anymore.
It should do the similar things for `persistent_term` data, say, delete all _unused
terms_ to free memory.
In this case we run into the issue regarding scanning the _heaps_ in all processes.

So, using `global` dynamic modules with large static data seems to be more reasonable in spite of that fact that it significantly slows down the application startup due to the run-time compilation of these modules.
